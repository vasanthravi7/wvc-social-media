Introducing Laila, an inspiring 18-year-old changemaker from Tanzania, who is at the forefront of promoting adolescent health and rights through the AHADI project. As the lead volunteer, Laila is dedicated to empowering her peers with essential knowledge on sexual and reproductive health, advocating for youth-friendly services and confidentiality within healthcare settings. 

Her passion is encapsulated in her belief that “If you help us, maybe we will be able to help your child tomorrow.” This statement reflects not only her commitment to her community but also emphasizes the importance of equipping young people with the tools they need for a healthier future.

Laila's work underscores a critical conversation about the necessity of supporting youth voices in the fight for gender equality and transformed health systems. Together, we have the opportunity to foster an environment where the next generation can thrive. 

Let us stand with Laila and the AHADI team in advocating for adolescent health, empowering our youth, and driving global change.
